SHA256 ..> Mem : For context allocations
Timing ..> Mem : For logger allocations (if any)

note right of SHA256
  Provides SHA-256 hashing functionality.
  Depends on the memory manager for its context structure.
end note

note left of Timing
  Provides high-resolution timing
  and measurement tools.
end note

note bottom of Sync
  Provides fundamental synchronization
  primitives like mutexes, often built
  using atomic operations.
end note

note bottom of Atomic
  Provides atomic operations for
  thread-safe manipulations of variables.
  This is a fundamental building block.
end note
