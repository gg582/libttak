Lib\+TTAK provides safer C development by following memory lifetime. All dynamically allocated variables using libttak have its own lifetime. If the variable\textquotesingle{}s lifefime is expired, you can call memory cleaner function to safely clean garbages without GC.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Collect your garbages when you {\bfseries{want to clean}}
\item No stop-\/and-\/go GC.
\item Every memory blocks have lifetime.

You can see {\ttfamily apps} example. This can run complex math programs without bad memory management so easily.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{C is good, if you stay safe.}{C is good, if you stay safe.}}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
Lib\+TTAK aims for safety over performance. Contrary to common belief, it will not provide superior performance; its performance is similar to C++. However, this still follow C-\/style programming, and you don\textquotesingle{}t need to seek massive C++ documents. No iterators, every syntax is clear.

If you use proper technique to prevent dangerous patterns, C is good, and sometimes it is even better than C++. Lib\+TTAK will help you to develop {\ttfamily adequate} C programs.
